  <!-- Pages -->
    <div id="black" class="page active">
    <h1>Home</h1>
    <p>This is the home page which I added because it seemed necessary. This
      is the process journal I used while designing this shoe.</p>
  </div>
  
  <div id="yellow" class="page">
    <h1>Testing</h1>
    <img src="images/Test.png" alt="Chicken" width="50">
    <p>The idea is to test it by seeing how durable and noticeable it is.
I will also see reviews and stuff. I want to see if I should improve the design for more fashion wanting people.
</p>
  </div>

  <div id="green" class="page">
    <h1>Evaluation</h1>
    <p>Some problems are that the shoes are made of paper, 
      and will not last very long, making them a waste of money.
      They will also cause a risk of paper cuts, and have so many 
      ways to easily get destroyed unintentionally, like fire or water or rips/tears.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="blue" class="page">
    <h1>Future Improvements</h1>
    <p>This shoe is better than the original for many reasons. 
      It is more shoe-shaped, and it is sturdier. This shoe will last 
      a lot longer than other shoes and can be painted without its main 
      shape really changing. It also has a functioning tongue, and it can
      be made in multiple different sizes. It can also be more water
      resistant if it is coated with acrylic paint. The shoe will hold
      much more strongly and be more protective, with only being 
      made of wood and cardboard.
</p>
  </div>

  <div id="red" class="page">
    <h1>Impact</h1>
    <h3>Economy</h3>
    <p>Good for the environmental state of the world. This is because 
      it is made of paper and wood. Wood is biodegradable because it 
      comes from trees, and paper also comes from trees.</p>
    <h3>Well Being</h3>
    <p>This is extremely cheap because it is made of paper and wood. Paper
      and wood come from trees and are accessible all around the world (almost).
      Trees can grow where there are good environments, so as long as it is not
      too cold (just Antarctica really) and it is not in the ocean 
      (with some exceptions) and it is not in the desert and not underground, it 
      should be fine. That seems limited, but those conditions for 
      trees also apply to where people can live.
